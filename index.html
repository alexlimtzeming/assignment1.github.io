    <p> Marina Barrage is at the southern tip of the main island, and a short walk away from Gardens by the Bay. This multi-purpose tourist attraction is both a rooftop dam and a park. Although its primary function serves as a dam, Marina Barrage is rather popular for recreation on its green, roof-top expanse. Visitors here especially enjoy kite flying the most, since the park is held on a rooftop space.</p>
